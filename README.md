## Testing

Testing was done in a number of ways.

 #### Manual Testing
 
 This was undertaken by Myself, my Wife and a number of friends aswell as the Code Institute slack channels.
 We tested all links to confirm they worked and opened on a new blank page. Multiple devices were used to confirm the site worked as it should and it displayed correctly across different screen sizes and browsers.

 ---

 #### Online Testing

 All code was run through a validator and returned zero errors.
 These validator sites were:

- [Jigsaw css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri)
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

---

#### Responsivity Testing

This website allowed me to select a number of devices with different size screens and viewports and see how my website looked on each of them.

- [Responsive Checker](https://responsivechecker.net/responsive)




Screenshots of all these results can be found in the docs file.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the help and support given by my mentor Chris Quinn, all of the students in my own study group aswell as all the students in the wider Code Institute Slack channels. My cohort Facilitator Kasia Bogucka and all of the staff at Code Institute.
