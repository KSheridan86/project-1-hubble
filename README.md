## Description
This project was designed to give a user who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope a brief understanding of what it is, what it does, it's history and contributions to science.

It will also include multiple examples of Hubbles imagery.

------
## Theme 

I wanted the theme of this site to closely align with the content.

Minimal, Clean, Slick, Professional.


Therefore i chose only a few simple colors to highlight the quality of the images themselves.

These were:
- #000 Black
- #CCC Off White/Light Grey
- #80b0bb Light blue/ Faintly Steel.

I then implemented a scroll style which would maximize the impact of the images.
By giving the images a position of "sticky" in the css file they would stick to the top of the page and let the following text roll over the top.
To enhance this effect i gave the text sections an opaque background so even as they were covering the image you could still see it holding firm on the top of the page.

## Testing

Testing was done in a number of ways.

 #### Manual Testing
 
 This was undertaken by Myself, my wife and a number of friends aswell as the Code Institute slack channels.
 We tested all links to confirm they worked and opened on a new blank page and went where they were supposed to. Multiple devices were used to confirm the site worked as it should and it displayed correctly across different screen sizes and browsers.


 #### Online Testing

 All code was run through a validator and returned zero errors.
 These validator sites were:

- [Jigsaw css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri)
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)


#### Responsivity Testing

This website allowed me to select a number of devices with different size screens and viewports and see how my website looked on each of them.

- [Responsive Checker](https://responsivechecker.net/responsive)




Screenshots of all these results can be found below.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using GitHub pages.
The procedure for doing this is very straight forward.

- Inside the repository click on the button marked "Settings".
- In the side bar on the left click on the button marked "Pages".
- Under the source title you have two drop down menus, make sure the first is set to "Main" and the second to "Root" and click "Save".
- Within a couple of minutes the site was live and i received a notification indicating the url.
