        Behind Hubble’s captivating images and groundbreaking science is a team of people who control the telescope,
        ensure its health and safety, and innovate ways to keep it at top performance more than three decades after its
        launch.
        This group of engineers, scientists, and operators at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center work together to
        monitor Hubble
        as it travels around Earth, point the telescope at cosmic targets, and solve any problems that arise.
        They perform their work in specialized facilities that provide the tools and equipment needed to operate this
        great observatory and continue its legacy of success.

      <h4>Hubble is operated by commands from the ground. Several spacecraft systems are in place to keep Hubble
        functioning smoothly.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Communications Antennas</li>
        <li>
          <p> Hubble performs in response to detailed instructions from people on the ground.
            The antennas allow technicians to communicate with the telescope, telling it what to do and when to do it.
            Four antennas receive and send information to a set of satellites, which in turn communicate with Earth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Solar arrays</li>
        <li>
          <p> Hubble is powered by sunlight. Each wing-like array has solar cells that convert the Sun’s energy into
            electricity.
            Some of that electricity runs the telescope, some is stored in onboard batteries for the periods when Hubble
            is in Earth’s shadow.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Computers and automation</li>
        <li>
          <p> Several computers and microprocessors reside in Hubble’s body and in each science instrument. There are
            two
            main computers.
            One talks to the instruments, sends commands and other information, and transmits data; the other handles
            pointing control,
            gyroscopes and other system-wide functions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Thermal protection</li>
        <li>
          <p> Hubble has a blanket of multilayered insulation, which protects the telescope from temperature extremes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Pointing system</li>
        <li>
          <p> Hubble uses a combination of gyroscopes, reaction wheels and Fine Guidance Sensors to orient itself.</p>
        </li>
